<p id="F">Agri'future at the service of families: <br>Agri'futur products, ecologically and educationally valuable, are ideal for families with children. In fact, our greenhouses will allow them to observe and understand the fragile nature that surrounds them (observing the evolution of plants and the development and actions of the ladybirds through the installation of the beehive), while at the same time making them aware of the ecological cause and the good that is eaten, issues that are at the centre of interest today. </p>

<p id="FGH">Agri'future, for a greener world: <br> In order to be able to offer you products of rarely achieved quality, Agri'futur works together with its greatest ally: nature! <br>
Thanks to its product range, which is designed to limit the carbon footprint of its greenhouses as much as possible, Agri'futur guarantees full respect for the fragile nature that surrounds us.<br>
With Agri'futur, no more pollution and other OMGs, and "Hello" well-being, happiness and health!</p>

<p id="FG"> When ecology rhymes with economy : <br>It is often thought that ecology is spending money...wrongly! In fact, over 1 year and by producing 10 m² of vegetable garden for only a part of the year, 10 m² of vegetable garden can save more than 100 Euro of fresh vegetables!
Agri'futur's greenhouses do not all have such a large surface area, but they protect your protégés much more than an open-air vegetable garden, all year round. At the same time, they save maintenance time and make the investment in purchasing your greenhouse quickly profitable!
Now that it's on Agrifutur, you won't lose a radish!</p>

<h2 id="AUDD">Did you know that?</h2>

<div id="NZT">
<p id="Che">The hexagonal shape of Agri'futur's greenhouses is the most suitable for heat distribution and conservation !</p>

<p id="Che">In France, a household of 4 people (2 parents and their children) consumes on average about 83 kg of vegetables per year for a total of almost 200 euros (fruit consumption not included), mostly in supermarkets, with a nutritional quality and taste far below that which you can get in the Agri'futur greenhouses!</p>

<p id="Che">Fruit and vegetables are the ones that require the least maintenance and produce the best yields: Radishes, lettuce, cauliflower, raspberry, strawberry, zucchini, carrot or even beans eat it all (to be found in our "Shop" section).</p>
